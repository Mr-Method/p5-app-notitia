Month View
----------------
The main "rota" menu item leads to this months calendar display. This page has a square for each day of the month, with each square having a heading row and three further rows - one for the controller slots and one for each of the day and night rider slots. The individual slots within the duty are smaller squares within the row.

When any particular slot is unfilled, it remains grey. When a rider, driver or controller claims a duty slot, the corresponding small square will contain a C (for "claimed"). If the rider that claimed the slot also requested a duty vehicle, the square will instead contain a red R (for "requested"). If a vehicle has been allocated to that rider for that slot, the square will instead contain a V (for "vehicle allocated") and the background of the square with be the colour assigned to the vehicle allocated.

Hovering the mouse over a slot will pop up brief details of the assignment of the slot.

On the right hand navigation menu, you can select a particular week within the current month. This will take you to the slots for that week. This shows the vehicles and the slot(s) to which they have been allocated.

Day View
-------------
Clicking on a day-square on the month calendar will take you to a page with more detail on that day, where you can see the riders and controllers that have claimed the slots, the requests for vehicles and any that have already been allocated. If there are pending vehicle allocation requests, they can be satisfied here (if you have the "Rota Manager" role)

Spreadsheet View
-------------------------
If you have the "Rota Manager" role, you will see the Spreasheet entry in the right hand navigation menu. Clicking this will take you to a page with the month's slots in a spreasheet view. This is mostly for vehicle assignment tasks. Each day has an area on the sheet and where a vehicle allocation has been requested, a dropdown allows the selection of the vehicle to assign. A table below the spreadsheet shows all the vehicles with their colours and details and location of the "current" keeper.

When assigning a vehicle, next to the name of the vehicle, the dropdown will show the approximate distance (in km) from it's current location to the location of the allocation.
