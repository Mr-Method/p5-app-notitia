###### Roles

There are many "roles" defined in the system that control what a user is
allowed to do in the system and what their duties include in the organisation.

![ManagementR]([%links.assets%]management-rolelist.png)

###### General operational roles:

*  Controller
*  Driver
*  Rider
*  Fund Raiser

###### Administrative roles:

*  Administrator - General access to the system admin functions. This does not allow access to everything, but does allow sufficient access to add or remove further roles.
*  Address Viewer - Access to everyone's contact details
*  Editor - Access to create/delete/edit documentation pages
*  Event Manager - Access to add/delete/edit events.
*  Person Manager - Access to view and edit everyone's personal information, and to manage their roles, certifications etc.
*  Rota Manager - Access to edit the main rota, assign vehicles.
*  Training Manager - Access to the certifications and personal documents, assign certifications.

###### Certifications

To perform certain functions, people need to have some certifications; evidence
that they have the appropriate qualifications or training. A rider, for
instance, normally requires 4 certifications to be able to claim a rider slot
on the rota - "Cat. A licence", "Advanced Motorcycle", "Route" (training) and
"GMP" (training).

Also on the certifications page is access to the personal document store. This
is where documentary evidence of accreditations (IAM pass certs, DVLA
transripts etc) can be stored, viewed and retrieved.

###### Endorsements

For riders and drivers, we keep a record of any endorsements on their licence.
