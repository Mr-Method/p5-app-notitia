The Management Menu gives access to Events, People and Vehicle management functions. 

<p>&nbsp;<p>

### People
From here, assuming you have the appropriate Roles, you can add or edit peoples details, add or remove roles, add or remove certifications and for riders and drivers, add/remove licence endorsement records.

#### Roles 
There are many "roles" defined in the system that control what a user is allowed to do in the system and what their duties include in the organisation.

##### General operational roles:

*  Controller 
*  Driver 
*  Rider
*  Fund Raiser

<p>&nbsp;<p>
##### Administrative roles:

*  Administrator - General access to the system admin functions. This does not allow access to everything, but does allow sufficient access to add or remove further roles.  
*  Address Viewer - Access to everyone's contact details  
*  Editor - Access to create/delete/edit documentation pages  
*  Event Manager - Access to add/delete/edit events. 
*  Person Manager - Access to view and edit everyone's personal information, and to manage their roles, certifications etc.
*  Rota Manager - Access to edit the main rota, assign vehicles.

<p>&nbsp;<p>

#### Certifications
To perform certain functions, people need to have some certifications; evidence that they have the appropriate qualifications or training. A rider, for instance, normally requires 4 certifications to be able to claim a rider slot on the rota - "Cat. A licence", "Advanced Motorcycle", "Route" (training) and "GMP" (training).

#### Endorsements
For riders and drivers, we keep a record of any endorsements on their licence.

### Types
As noted above, some duties need to have certain certifications to be allowed on the rota. Slot Roles here allows Administrator users to define the certifications for those duties.

### Vehicles
This menu allows access to the details of all the vehicles in the system. 


![ManagementV]([%links.assets%]management-vehicles.png)


Some will be "personal" vehicles that users own that they may use for occasional duty, others will be vehicles owned and maintained by the organisation.  For "Service" vehicles, here we can define events for the vehicle (12k mile service for instance) so that it will be unavailable for allocation and will appear on the rota.
